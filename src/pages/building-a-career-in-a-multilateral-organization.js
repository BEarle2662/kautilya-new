                        Multilateral organizations are formed by three or more nations to work on issues that are relevant to each of them. They are inclusive and permit participation by all in the management of world affairs thereby ensuring the legitimacy of their efforts being widely implemented.

                        Working for Multilateral organizations enables individuals to create change at a macro level. Individuals are exposed to different countries and settings and obtain diverse skillsets. Working for these organizations requires individuals to be critical thinkers, have a global outlook, and be willing to adapt to constant changes.

                        The event is organised to provide students with an understanding of how to plan and approach a career in a multilateral organization. They get to hear firsthand from global experts about the technical expertise, soft skills, and networks required to work in such organizations, and also about how a Master’s Degree in Public Policy can help them.
