                        The government of India is all set to introduce a new bill in this parliament session to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies. With more than 300 million cryptocurrency users worldwide, it has become the biggest buzzword globally. The widespread use and investments show terrific potential for a decentralized yet secure medium of exchange with untold implications for global finance. Different cryptocurrency exchanges offer various types of cryptocurrencies and have different terms, policies, payment methods, and fees. Exchanges also differ on aspects such as security, user-friendliness, functionality, and design.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-left mb-4">
                        Critics however, argue that cryptocurrency is highly volatile, inconvenient, and designed to facilitate illegal conduct. It is depicted as a major threat to the current financial system. The lack of transparency and accountability can jinx the benefits of digital currencies and in different industries beyond finance. Talks over regulation of digital currencies and crypto exchanges are a way to help the market become healthier and more transparent. There is a lot of work to be done and use the combination of technology, knowledge and accountability to fight these flaws.
